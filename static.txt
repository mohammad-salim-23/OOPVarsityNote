##What is static?

static is a keyword in Java used to indicate that a variable, method, or block belongs to the class 
rather than a specific instance (object).
It means the member is shared among all instances of the class.

##When to Use static?

When you want to create shared resources (e.g., a counter that all objects should access).
When a method does not depend on object data (e.g., Math.pow()).
When you need a common utility method that should be called without creating an object.
