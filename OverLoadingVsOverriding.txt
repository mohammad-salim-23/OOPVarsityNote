Overloading vs Overriding (Easy Explanation)
##Method Overloading

Happens within the same class.
Uses the same method name but with different parameters (different number or types of arguments).
Occurs at compile-time (early binding).
Helps to perform similar actions with different inputs.
The return type can be different.
There are no restrictions on access modifiers.

##Method Overriding
Happens in different classes with a parent-child relationship (inheritance).
Uses the same method name and parameters, but modifies the behavior in the child class.
Occurs at runtime (late binding).
Used when you need to change the behavior of a parent class method in a child class.
The return type must be the same or a child type.
You cannot reduce visibility (e.g., a public method in the parent class cannot be private in the child class).
