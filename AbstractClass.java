/*
 * An abstract class is an incomplete class, meaning it can have abstract methods that do not have a body (implementation).

ðŸ”¹ Why is it used?

If we want some methods to be present in all subclasses but with different implementations, we use abstract.
It provides a guideline for other classes through inheritance.

/*
 * ðŸ”¹ Key Points
âœ” You cannot create an object of an abstract class.
âœ” A subclass must complete the abstract methods.
âœ” Abstract classes can have normal methods too.
